# Hello, I am Ishant 👋

This repo shows my python experience, including projects and practice.

## Portfolio Projects
These are the main projects that best show my web development skill:

1. [Webscraping Program with Selenium](/Python_ML/Webscraping/) - This is a python project that uses Selenium to browse through a scholarship website, and then interact with a Notion database and google calendar to set reminders.

2. [Simple Neural Network](/Python_ML/SimpleNN/) - This is a simple neural network made using Pytorch. I followed [this tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCC34OHNcOtpcgR9LEYSdi9r7XIbpkpK1&si=mRNG7Xmc6k2fR6lJ) made by Codemy.

## Practice Exercises and Small Projects

In my Practice folder, I have small exercises to understand different topics in Python.
